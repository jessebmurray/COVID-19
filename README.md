# COVID-19
Visualizations and other stuff for COVID-19


For this gif, I got the county population and COVID-19 cases data from USA facts and I got county land area data from the 2010 US census. I made the images via the pandas and seaborn libraries with python.

For this plot, I got the data from google search trends (link below) and I made the graph using the pandas and seaborn libraries. The goal is to show the hockeystick-like rise in searches due to COVID-19. The lineplot points show the average and the error bands show the 95% CI for each month.
